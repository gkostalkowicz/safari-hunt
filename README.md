This is a nice photo-camera-like application that demonstrates some HTML5 and CSS3 features.
It's not particularly big, but creating it was a lot of fun.

**Works ONLY with Firefox 44 and Chrome 49.**
**Other browsers were not tested (mobile included).**
Internet Explorer 11 doesn't support CSS3 filter and it would be more problematic to make it work.

**This is not a production grade code.**
It has a bad design and a lot of flaws. Some things to improve:
- Check the browser compatibility.
- Split the code into modules.
- MVC pattern would come in handy.
- Some data binding to form elements. The current system is a mess.

Suggestions for further improvements:
- Loading pictures through drag and drop.
- Animations while: changing screen, adding new photo.
- Responsive design.
- Removing photos.
- Saving photos or a gallery to file.
- Making back and forward buttons work.
